## Using AI Core to Train a Model for Pose Estimation

This track introduces you to using AI Core to deploy your own custom training workflows.

### Prerequisite

1. Follow [this](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/hcp-create-trial-account..html
) trial to make a BTP trial account and follow [this](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/appstudio-onboarding..html) tutorial to use Business Application Studio.
2. Open up a terminal session at the root of the cloned repository. It is highly suggested to create a virtual Python environment for following along to avoid conflicts with other packages that could be already installed on your system. A virtual environment can be created using `python3 -m venv .venv`. Activate the environment in your current terminal session using `source .venv/bin/activate`. Make sure that all subsequent steps are executed within the context of this newly created virtual environment.
3. Install the [SAP generative AI hub SDK](https://pypi.org/project/generative-ai-hub-sdk/) using pip: `pip install "generative-ai-hub-sdk[all]"`.
4. Download the file `creds.json` that is shared with you and store it in this project directory.

### Exercises

The exercises are comprised of notebooks demonstrating how to use the SAP generative AI hub SDK to interact with the Orchestration Service, enabling you to build AI-driven workflows by combining multiple modules such as templating, large language models (LLM), and content filtering.
