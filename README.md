## Using AI Core to Train a Model for Pose Estimation

This track introduces you to using AI Core to deploy your own custom training workflows. We will train a simple neural network to classify yoga poses given an input image. We will use a dataset called [Yoga-82](https://sites.google.com/view/yoga-82/home) that has images and labels for 82 different yoga poses. The images are first converted to pose embeddings using a pose detection model called [MoveNet](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/tutorials/movenet). The model takes an input image and outputs a 17-dimensional vector representing the locations of 17 keypoints of the body. After generating the MoveNet pose embeddings, we will pass these into a simple 4-layer feed-forward network (defined in `model_utils.py`) to classify the pose embedding into 1 of the 82 yoga pose labels. The preprocessing of generating MoveNet embeddings is already done for you, and the data is located in `data/pose_embeddings.csv`. There is also metadata containing the labels and statistics about the image's pixel values (located in `data/metadata.csv`). An example of inference on a video is located in `model/inference.mp4`.

### Prerequisites

1. Follow [this](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/hcp-create-trial-account..html
) trial to make a BTP trial account and follow [this](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/appstudio-onboarding..html) tutorial to use Business Application Studio. Create a dev space of type `Full Stack Cloud Application`. Make sure to select the `Docker Image Builder` and `Python Tools` extensions when you create the space.
2. Open up a terminal session at the root of the cloned repository. It is highly suggested to create a virtual Python environment for following along to avoid conflicts with other packages that could be already installed on your system. A virtual environment can be created using `python3 -m venv .venv`. Activate the environment in your current terminal session using `source .venv/bin/activate`. Make sure that all subsequent steps are executed within the context of this newly created virtual environment.
3. Install the requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt`. We will be using the Python [SDK](https://pypi.org/project/ai-core-sdk/) for AI Core. 
4. Download the `aicore_creds.json`, `docker_creds.json`, `gh_creds.json`, and `s3_creds.json` that are shared with you and store them in this project directory. Note that these credentials will expire shortly! You will need to get your own credentials by subscribing to your own AI Core instance, creating a Docker PAT, Github PAT, and S3 bucket.

### Deploying a Training Workflow

Open the notebook `deploy_training_workflow.ipynb` and follow the steps.
